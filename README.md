# sla - Simple Little Automator ðŸ¥—

Tired of Make's moronic syntax and rules? Not working on a project that
requires incremental compilation? ðŸ˜­ when you need to install 2.4
GiB of Ruby dependencies for a simple build system? Want to be able to execute
simple build rules from anywhere in your project tree? Then `sla` is for you!

sla is the Simple Little Automator. It's a tiny shell script that invokes
shell functions found in a `build.sla` script in your project's root dir. It
is ideal for smaller projects and projects that don't require compilation,
such as scripting languages.

## Why?

Every task running / build system I've researched is either for a specific
language, too large or complicated or uses declarative style build rules.
Declarative rules are very limited in their capabilities. It's often not even
possible, or very awkward, to do loops. This immediately leads to the
creation of helper shell scripts. The build tool then becomes nothing more
than a wrapper around those scripts. So why not use shell scripts right away?
That's what Sla does.

Using shell scripting has several benefits:

* It's not limited to a single language. Most projects don't just need to
  compile code. They also need to setup projects, run tests, generate
  documentation, etc. Interpreted languages don't require incremental builds
  at all, making most build systems' core functionality useless.
* It's cross-platform, so it will run everywhere.
* It's powerful. You can script basically anything.
* You don't even need Sla installed. You can run build rules directly through
  the shell. Sla is just a simple convenient wrapper.
* It's easy to call other build systems such as Make through sla, so we don't
  lose any functionality such as incremental builds.

Additionally, Sla has some benefits of its own:

* It allows you to list the available rules, something Make still can't do
  properly after 43 years.
* You can include short and long descriptions / help for build rules.
* You can run target rules from anywhere in your project.
* Sla automatically times your builds.

## Usage

Here's the output of `--help`, although there's not much to see:

    Usage: sla [-hdv] [--version] <rule> [param [param...]]

    Simple Little Automator. Find and execute tasks from a shell script.

    Arguments:
      -h, --help      Show this help message
      -d, --debug     Show debug information
      -v, --verbose   Verbose output
      -V, --version   Show sla version

    If no <rule> is specified, lists the available rules.

    Use '/home/fboender/.local/bin/sla <rule> --help' to show a rule's full description.

You can use the `--verbose` option to show what your rules are executing.
Basically the same as doing `set -x` in your script.

### Example usage

Here's an example of running `sla` with the `test` rule:

    ~/Projects/my_project/src/llt/ $ sla test
    ./src/tools.py:25:80: E501 line too long (111 > 79 characters)
    Exection of rule 'test' failed with exitcode 2. Duration: 0h 0m 1s

`sla` searches up the current path until it finds a `build.sla` file, changes
to that directory, sources it in the shell, and executes the requested shell
function. Here's what the `build.sla` file for the above 'test' rule might
look like:

    ~/Projects/my_project/src/llt/ $ cat ../../build.sla
    #
    # This is a script containing functions that are used as build rules. You can
    # use the Simple Little Automator (https://github.com/fboender/sla) to run
    # these rules, or you can run them directly in your shell:
    #
    #   $ bash -c ". build.sla && test"
    #

    clean () {
        # Clean artifacts and trash from repo
        find ./ -name "*.pyc" -delete
        find ./ -name "*.tmp" -delete
    }

    test () {
        # Run some code tests
        clean  # Depend on 'clean' rule
        flake8 --exclude src/llt --ignore=E501 src/*.py
    }

As you can see, build rules are just plain old shell functions. Sla used bash,
which should be available just about everywhere.

Creating dependencies on other rules is as simple as calling it as a normal
shell function.

You can list available rules by simply omitting a rule name:

    $ sla
    Available rules:
      - doc: Generate documentation
      - clean: Clean artifacts and trash from repo
      - test: Run some code tests
      - install: Install the program

Functions that start with an underscore ('`_`') are not shown.

### Documenting rules

Comments at the start of a function / rule definition are parsed as
documentation. Take the following rule definition for example:

    install () {
        # Install sla 
        # Install sla to $PREFIX (/usr/local by default).
        #
        # You can specify the prefix with an environment variable:
        # 
        #     $ PREFIX=/usr sla install

        # Set the prefix
        PREFIX=${PREFIX:-/usr/local}
        DEST="$PREFIX/bin/sla"
        env install -m 755 ./sla "$DEST"
        echo "sla installed in $DEST"
    }
    
In this case the first line is the short description. It is shown when listing
the rules. The rest of the comments, up to the empty line, are shown when
requesting a rule's documentation with `sla <rule> --help`. For example:

    $ sla install --help
    install: Install sla
        
         Install sla to $PREFIX (/usr/local by default).
        
         You can specify the prefix with an environment variable:
         
             $ PREFIX=/usr sla install

### Running rules without `sla`

Since `sla` rules are just plain old shell functions, you don't even need
`sla` installed to run them!:

    ~/Projects/my_project $ bash -c ". build.sla && test"
    ./src/tools.py:25:80: E501 line too long (111 > 79 characters)

That's useful so that people don't need to install the build system you prefer
just to do a `make install`.

### Passing values

You can pass values as environment variables:

    $ export TARGET=/usr/local
    $ sla install  # installs in /usr/local

or

    TARGET=/usr/local sla install

You can also pass command-line arguments:

    sla install /usr/local

These become available as normal positional arguments in a rule / shell
function:

    install () {
        TARGET=$1
    }

### Dependencies

Creating dependencies is as easy as calling a shell function. In the following
example, the `test` rule depends on the `lint` rule and the `unittest` rule:

    lint () {
        # Scan code for common problems
        flake8 src/*.py
    }

    unittest () {
        # Run all unit tests
        cd src/
        nosetests
    }

    test () {
        # Run all tests
        lint
        unittest
    }

If a dependency only needs to be executed once (such as `clean` rules), just
set a flag in the rule. For example:

    clean () {
        if [ -z "$CLEANED" ]; then
            echo "Cleaning"
            # Your cleaning instructions here.
            CLEANED=1
        fi
    }


### Tips and tricks

#### Disabling strictness

`sla` will stop running as soon as a command returns a non-zero exit code. You
can turn this off by wrapping a block of code with `set +e` statements:

    set +e
    # these commands won't cause Sla to stop if their exit codes are != 0
    rm nonexisting
    set -e

#### Automatic execution of rules

You can use a tool like [entr](http://entrproject.org/) to automatically
execute rules when files change:

    $ find ./ -name "*.1.md" | entr sla doc
    Converting sec-diff.1.md
    Execution of rule 'doc' succeeded with exitcode 0. Duration: 0h 0m 0s

The `doc` rule converts a Markdown file to a manual page. `entr` watches all
changes to `*.1.md` files in the project, and if any of them change, it
executes `sla doc` to regenerate all man pages.

#### 'install' rule

If you have a rule called "install", and you also want to use the `install`
unix tool to install software, you'll end up with an endless loop, unless you
specify that you want to use the system's `install` and not the shell function
you just wrote. You can use `env` for that:

    install () {
        env install -m 755 ./sla "$DEST"
    }

#### Bash Autocompletion

To get auto completion for bash, put in your `~/.bashrc`:

    # Complete sla rules
    _complete_sla_rules()
    {
        COMPREPLY=()
        cur="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"
        comp=$(sla 2>/dev/null | grep "^ -" | sed "s/^ - \([^:]*\).*/\1/")
        COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "${comp}" -- $cur))
        return 0
    }
    complete -F _complete_sla_rules sla

## Installation

You can install `sla` with itself from the repo.

System-wide:

    git clone https://github.com/fboender/sla.git
    cd sla
    sudo ./sla install

Just for your user:

    git clone https://github.com/fboender/sla.git
    cd sla
    PREFIX=~/.local ./sla install
    
For the above to work, you should have `~/.local/bin` in your PATH.
