# This is a script containing functions that are used as build rules. You can
# use the Simple Little Automator (https://github.com/fboender/sla.git) to run
# these rules, or you can run them directly in your shell:
#
#   $ bash -c ". build.sla && test"
#

test () {
    # Run 'sla' through the shellcheck linter
    shellcheck -e SC1117 sla
}
